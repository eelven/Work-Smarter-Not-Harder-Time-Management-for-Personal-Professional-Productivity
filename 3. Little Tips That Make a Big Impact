3. Little Tips That Make a Big Impact (21min)

3.1 How Long Will This Take? (4min)

Estimating
How do we estimate?
.Experience is the best tool
.Keep good notes
.Use tables
.Use spreadsheets

Formula For Estimate
Initial estimate of time required to complete work - How long the work actually took = Variance

Analogous Estimate
Comparing similar finished work in order to find a time estimate to complete new work

Parametric Estimating
Using historical data, including variables, to estimate time to complete new work

15min. to validate 1 month of data x 3 months of new work = 45 total min. of estimated new work required

Parametric Estimating
Historical data (How long work took in the past) x How many times you will need to do it again = Data Validation Time

3.2 Managing Communications (9min)

Schedule Specific Time for Communication
Or, wait until there's a need to spend time on communication

Communications
Expand your inbox to use multiple folders
-Do it Right Away
-Action Folder
-Pending Folder (requires follow up)
-Information Folder

we have clerarly marked folders, like for actions versus pending versus information.

and the other category is, Do it.

Email Communication
Classify Email by your Inbox folders
- If it's quick to do -> Do it
-Information email -> File it in Information
-Actionable email -> File it into Action, then schedule it into your work plan and calendar
-An email reply -> File it into Pending, then create a reminder on calendar

Keep Similar Information Together
.Calendars
.Contacts
.Personal items
.Work items

multiple Calendars: Work, family activities, church calendar, study calendar: Overbooking.
The same problem for electronically, if you use multiple calendars and you don't sync them up
so, don't do that, Keep similar data together, Make it easy to read and understand, color code
your calendars, and your life is gonna be so much easier.

Keep your contact information in one easy to find and access location too.

Put your glasses, sunglasses, keys, wallet, purse in the same place too

Whenever possible, plan your work, so that you perform similar tasks together

Time of Day vs. Productivity
Schedule your most challenging work for when you are most productive.
Check and recheck your work during your difficult time.
