2.1 The Myth of Work-Life Balance (5min)

"We often, maybe even mostly, let our schedule schedule itself,
Ignoring the fact that time, not money, is our only true leadership asset."
-Tom Peters

2.2 Where Does the Time Go? (8min)

The best way to know where your time goes is to keep track.
Time tracking allows oneself to reveal what is actually done
throughout the day
Keep Yourself Honest
Knowledge is power

It's time to combine your definition of work life balance with your
understanding of how you spend your time, because you only have so
many hours in your day. Let's make sure you are planning them well.

Once you understand where your time goes, you can begin to determine
where you can fine-tune your schedule and your approach to your work
The concepts we are discussing is called Strategic Reserve Time,
drawn from The Juggler's Guide to Managing Multiple Projects - Michael
Singer Dobson.
The idea is to start with how many hours you're going to give to work
and them look at how much time it takes for you to perform your basic
job functions.
The time leftover is the time you have to spend on special work, such
as projects. This is your strategic reserve time.

Basic job functions - How many hours to complete this work = Strategic
Reserve Time

SRT That is the time you have ti do other things, special projects,
things that weren't part of your, ...

Personal Strategic Reserve Time
time available to do all tasks - all commitments = SRT

How much time do you have to do something new or something different
at week, and if you have no time, is that okay?
If you wind up a negative number, it means you don't have enough hours
in the day, in the week to do everything that you want to do. And now
that means you're gonna need to prioritize.

Awareness on your part as to what it takes for you to do your job.
